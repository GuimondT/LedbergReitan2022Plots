Plotting the results from Table 2 and Table 3 from their article on deaths post compulsory substance use treatment in Sweden from 2000-2017.

These tables provide results from a Poisson regression that was used to estimate hazard rates from separate time windows while adjusting for additional covariates (gender, age, year of discharge). As they say in their manuscript: 

>"Time-interval-dependent hazard rates were estimated for external- and other causes of deaths separately using Poisson regression (e.g., Rodríguez, 2007). Assuming that hazard rates are constant in each interval, the estimates from the Poisson regression can be interpreted as estimates of hazard rates (Laird and Olivier, 1981, Rodríguez, 2007). Calendar year of discharge, sex, and age were included as covariates in the regressions. For the plots of marginal probability, two age groups were used (above and below the median age), and in the regression analyses, five age groups were used."

Here we make plots to help us interpret these results.
